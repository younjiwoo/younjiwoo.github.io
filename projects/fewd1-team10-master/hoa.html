Dues go up, costs go up, but for many associations, reserves are not able to keep up with the demand and in the meantime, our community associations continue to get older which in turn requires more maintenance and additional costs and the cycle continues. Conversely, many homeowners such as, those on fixed incomes, first time buyers and homeowners concerned with selling their units are interested in keeping dues as low as possible.</p>

                <dt class="questionBox">WHAT IS OUR OBJECTIVE?</dt>
                <dd>IIn California, there are estimated 35,000-40,000 community associations comprising condominiums, townhomes and single family associations (more being built every day). They represent an estimated 3,000,000 units and are occupied by an estimated 6,000,000 people. Annually, California community associations spend an estimated six billion dollars and own an estimated 450 billion dollars in property values.<br />In years prior to the La Paz Homeowners Association of Homeowners Association the value of condominiums and townhomes decreased in value at a faster rate and recovered at a slower rate than other single family homes and often the outstanding loan balance on condominiums and townhomes would be greater than the appraised value. This has been of great concern to us. Today this trend has changed. Community living has become the preferred mode of housing for many California homeowners.<br />For years Board members and homeowners have relied heavily on the Property Management industry for information and direction. This, at the time, was perhaps the only source of information. Today La Paz Homeowners Association, dedicated to strength in Unity and the Value and Enjoyment of Property, has placed a complete resource of information on the internet for Condominium and Community Association owners, property managers and others interested in this industry.<br />La Paz Homeowners Association, Inc. has been organized to benefit all condominium owners in California. Our purpose is to strengthen Boards of Directors and collectively unite the members of their respective associations. It has been formed to provide a complete and comprehensive collection of documents, laws and information for California’s condominium and townhome owners. It has also been organized to provide a means whereby homeowners’ associations can communicate with each other and thereby assemble the best current and relevant information from all associations throughout the state of California to the mutual benefit of each other. Ultimately, the purpose is to protect your investment, to increase property values and assure the reasonable enjoyment of your property.</dd>

                <dt class="questionBox">WE ARE CONCERNED</dt>
                <dd>We are concerned with the negative effect renters are having on the value and enjoyment of our property, and that the ratio of renters to owners is increasing annually. Have you considered that you pay a greater and disproportionate share of property taxes than other single family homeowners? Did you know that the State of California Department of Real Estate does not require property managers to obtain a license of any kind to management community property? Are you concerned with the perception and apprehension many people have about community living? We have been concerned with these and many other issues … and we have observed many improvements and successes.<br />La Paz Homeowners Association is committed to correct these matters. We have prompted legislation to address these issues and have assembled an impressive organization to accomplish our objectives. But we cannot succeed without your help. United we will change associations for the benefit of all condominium and townhome owners.</dd>

            <dl>
                <dt class="questionBox">INSURANCE</dt>
                <dd>The cost of HOA insurance has recently dramatically increased. We can reduce this cost, when associations adopt appropriate policies on an industry wide basis to manage their insurance coverage and work together to mitigate claims and losses. At the same time, we also convey a message to primary insurance companies and reinsurance companies that there is enormous strength, order and direction in the community association industry that will affect future insurance rates and regulations at state and federal levels.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt class="questionBox">UPDATING DOCUMENTS</dt>
                <dd>Why should each homeowner associations reinvent the wheel? It is common knowledge that the CC&amp;Rs, Bylaws and other association documents are out of date. So why should each association hire an attorney to update these documents at high costs? Could not a committee of attorneys bring the best of all associations together, prepare one generic document on computers and then attorneys could tailor a new document for each association at a fraction of the cost?</dd>
