# Racing Game

This is a Racing Game, where two players can move Tom or Jerry across the browser to compete for the win.

## Technologies Used

jQuery, JavaScript and CSS.

## Existing Features

Players can move their characters (Tom and Jerry) by pressing a specific key, which is "T" and "J".
The game keeps track of multiple game rounds with a win counter.
It displays a countdown timer ("3, 2, 1, Go!"), the winning time, and shows who won the round.

## Planned Features

I'm going to work on a bot so that a player can play against it.
